# 🧠 OpenCV Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Computer Vision practice repository!  
This repo documents my step-by-step learning with **OpenCV + Python**, organized into progressive phases - from basics to real-world tasks.

## 🔍 What I’m Practicing Here

### 🖼 Image Basics
- Reading & displaying images
- Color conversions (RGB ↔ Gray ↔ HSV)
- Resizing, cropping, scaling

### ✏️ Image Transformations
- Rotation, translation, flipping
- Blurring, sharpening, thresholding

### 🔍 Feature & Edge Detection
- Canny edge detection
- Sobel & Laplacian filters
- Corner/contour detection

### 😃 Face & Object Stuff
- Haar cascades
- Face detection
- Drawing bounding boxes

### 🎥 Working With Video
- Webcam capture
- Frame-by-frame processing
- Basic tracking logic

## 💻 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


## ▶️ How to Run

Navigate to any phase folder and run a script:

python filename.py


## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

Build a strong foundation in computer vision

Experiment freely and document progress

Develop projects using OpenCV + ML


## 🙌 Contribution

This is primarily a learning repo, but feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## Future Scope 

Will be adding the phases that are left in between and will be sharing it complete soon once I start with its revision
